# Workflow that builds a Docker image containing the model code,
# pushes it to the GitHub Container Registry, and then optionally uses
# that container image to run the model using an AWS Batch job.
#
# Images are built on every commit to a PR or main branch in order to ensure
# that the build continues to work properly, but Batch jobs are gated behind
# a `deploy` environment that requires manual approval from a
# @ccao-data/core-team member.
